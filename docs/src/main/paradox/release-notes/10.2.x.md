# 10.2.x Release Notes

We have released 10.2.0-M1, the first milestone leading up to version 10.2.0 of Akka HTTP.

Among other things, 10.2.0-M1 contains:

* Improved API's and documentation to improve the experience working with Akka 2.6 and the new Actor API's. Akka HTTP 10.2.0 will keep supporting Akka 2.5.

* Improved default configuration, such as [disabling transparent HEAD support by default](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2088).
* Various bug fixes, such as around [percent-encoding URI queries](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3003) and [parsing headers with unicode characters](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1484).
* Various improvements to HTTP/2 support, driven by [Akka gRPC](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc).
