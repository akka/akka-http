* Improved default configuration, such as [disabling transparent HEAD support by default](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2088).
* Various bug fixes, such as around [percent-encoding URI queries](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3003) and [parsing headers with unicode characters](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1484).
