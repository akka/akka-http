# 10.2.x Release Notes

## 10.2.0

### Migration notes

#### Scalatest dependency upgraded to 3.1.0

The Scalatest dependency for akka-http-testkit was upgraded to version 3.1.0. This version is incompatible with previous
versions. This is relevant for user code if it uses methods from @scaladoc[ScalatestUtils](akka.http.scaladsl.testkit.ScalatestUtils)
(which are in scope if your test extends from @scaladoc[ScalaTestRouteTest](akka.http.scaladsl.testkit.ScalaTestRouteTest)).
In this case, the project itself needs to update to use Scalatest >= 3.1.0.

#### Default parsing.max-content-length

Previously, the default maximum size for incoming entities was 8m. This default has now changed to
'infinite' for the client side (response parsing), while it remains at 8m for the server side
(request parsing).

Changing `akka.http.parsing.max-content-length`affects both the client and the server, while
`akka.http.client.parsing.max-content-length` or `akka.http.host-connection-pool.client.parsing`
affect the corresponding the client setting only.
