# 10.2.x Release Notes

Among other things, 10.2.0-RC1 contains:

* Some new features, including the ability to [attach attributes to requests and responses](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/10.2.0-M1/common/http-model.html#attributes).
* Allow client setting overrides for target hosts via configuration [#2574](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/2574)
* Improved default configuration, such as [disabling transparent HEAD support by default](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2088).
* Various bug fixes, such as around [percent-encoding URI queries](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3003) and [parsing headers with unicode characters](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1484).
* Various improvements to HTTP/2 support, driven by [Akka gRPC](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc).
* Support for Akka Coordinated Shutdown [#3142](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3142)
* Remove legacy host connection pool including settings and tests [#3188](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3188)
