# 10.2.x Release Notes

## 10.2.3

This release includes a working preview HTTP/2 client.

Other notable changes:

#### akka-http-core

* Better support for filename* in Content-Disposition [#3705](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3705)
* Warn if trying to bind flow/source with HTTP2 (which is not supported) [#3678](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3678)

#### akka-http-testkit

* Fetch chunks in the testkit without waiting for the whole response to finish [#3724](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3724)

#### docs

* Show examples of using the Akka HTTP BOM (bill of materials) in dependency blocks

## 10.2.2

This release includes a number of improvements to the HTTP/2 server support,
while we continue to prepare for providing HTTP/2 support at the client as
well.

As of this version, it is no longer strictly necessary to depend no a separate
'akka-http2-support' artifact to get HTTP/2 support in Akka HTTP. We will
continue to publish an empty artifact with that name to make it easy to
upgrade, however.

## 10.2.0

Akka Http 10.2 is a modernization release to improve the integration with the latest Akka versions, streamline APIs, and improve performance.

Since the original release of 10.1, the Akka project has introduced a few important features:

 * Akka 2.6 offers typed actors and ActorSystems
 * Akka Stream APIs were improved to work without requiring a `Materializer` in most cases
 * Akka gRPC 1.0 has been released which is built on top of Akka HTTP

Akka Http 10.2.0 supports these changes in the following ways:

 * Http APIs now work the same whether a classic or a typed ActorSystem is provided
 * A new concise API for binding servers has been introduced
 * A new set of directives @ref[handle](../routing-dsl/directives/route-directives/handle.md), and @ref[handleSync](../routing-dsl/directives/route-directives/handleSync.md)
   provide more options to seamlessly mix Akka gRPC generated service handlers with Akka Http routes. HTTP/2 support has been improved based on Akka gRPC usage.
 * Akka HTTP now supports Akka Coordinated Shutdown for server bindings.

### Seamless integration with Akka 2.6 and new server API entrypoints

Making changes to support Akka 2.6 better, we realized that the existing server API is sometimes awkward to use and to evolve. Therefore, we took the opportunity to come up
with a new @ref[ServerBuilder API](../migration-guide/migration-guide-10.2.x.md#new-serverbuilder-api-to-create-server-bindings) that provides a way to bind servers more
concisely, especially from Java.

Code like:

Scala
:   @@snip [AkkaHttp1020MigrationSpec.scala](/docs/src/test/scala/docs/http/scaladsl/server/AkkaHttp1020MigrationSpec.scala) { #old-binding }

Java
:   @@snip [AkkaHttp1020MigrationExample.java](/docs/src/test/java/docs/http/javadsl/server/AkkaHttp1020MigrationExample.java) { #old-binding }

can now be written as:

Scala
:   @@snip [AkkaHttp1020MigrationSpec.scala](/docs/src/test/scala/docs/http/scaladsl/server/AkkaHttp1020MigrationSpec.scala) { #new-binding }

Java
:   @@snip [AkkaHttp1020MigrationExample.java](/docs/src/test/java/docs/http/javadsl/server/AkkaHttp1020MigrationExample.java) { #new-binding }

Notably, server written with the routing DSL will now be automatically converted to an asynchronous handler (using the new pendant of `bindAndHandleAsync`) instead of
being provided as a Flow (using `bindAndHandle` before). This has the benefit that it fits the style of the routing DSL better which really represents an asynchronous handler
function and, more importantly, will enable routes to work automatically with HTTP/2 (when enabled).

The old APIs have been deprecated but will be kept for binary and source compatibility at least until 10.3 but maybe even longer (because they have been such a central part).

We made an effort to keep supporting Akka 2.5.x (>= 2.5.31) for this release to ease the migration burden. It required backporting some features from Akka 2.6 so that
seamless APIs would work the same with Akka 2.6 and Akka 2.5. The 10.2.x release line will be the last supporting Akka 2.5.

To do the migration you can run the following task in sbt if you have scalafix enabled in your project:

```
scalafixAll dependency:MigrateToServerBuilder@com.typesafe.akka:akka-http-scalafix-rules:10.2.0
```

See the @ref[migration notes](../migration-guide/migration-guide-10.2.x.md#akka-http-10-1-x-10-2-0) for more information about how to setup and use scalafix to do the migration.

### Routing DSL guidelines

Akka HTTP's routing DSL comes with great power once you have mastered it. However, the flexibility it provides can be hard to tame for new users or when
projects grow. We acknowledge these difficulties and want to conquer them with giving more guidelines to get started with building routes more
easily. For that reason, we created two new documentation pages to give advice about how routes can be organized for scale:

 * The new @ref[styleguide](../routing-dsl/style-guide.md) gives general recommendations about how to structure route source code.
 * A @ref[comparison with Play routes](../routing-dsl/play-comparison.md) gives a side-by-side overview of how routing features of Play and Akka HTTP compare to
   each other.

### Attributes for HttpRequest and HttpResponse

In many cases metadata needs to be attached to a HTTP message. Previously, this was accomplished by introducing synthetic headers to add to requests and responses. However,
this was more of a workaround that could lead to confusion about which headers should be rendered and where they originated. Akka Http 10.2 introduces attributes to HTTP messages.
These allow attaching and querying typed metadata values to messages.

See @ref[Attributes](../common/http-model.md#attributes) for more information.

### Default configuration improvements

Seldom used features have now been turned off by default:

 * Transparent HEAD support was disabled, see [#2088](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2088) and the @ref[migration notes](../migration-guide/migration-guide-10.2.x.md#transparent-head-requests-now-disabled-by-default) for information about the rationale.
 * Server-side HTTP pipelining was disabled by default. Common HTTP clients do not support it by default or have it disabled, so to reduce complexity in the common code paths
   the default `akka.http.server.pipelining-limit` was changed to `1`. See the @ref[migration notes](../migration-guide/migration-guide-10.2.x.md#server-side-http-pipelining-now-disabled-by-default) for more information.

### Better support for upcoming Scala versions

Scala 2.13 deprecated "adapted arguments" which were heavily used in the routing DSL with the magnet pattern. It allowed that a single method with a single argument could
take any number of arguments in a typesafe fashion by relying on the Scala compiler to convert those arguments to a tuple of arguments. Since a while we generally try to reduce our usage
of implicits and the magnet pattern to avoid complex compile error messages, long compile times, and complexity. With Akka Http 10.2 we made another effort to reduce our dependency on that
language feature by providing a set of code-generated overloads for the methods in question to pave our way for upcoming Scala versions.

See the @ref[migration guide](../migration-guide/migration-guide-10.2.x.md#parameters-formfields-scaladsl-) for more information.

### Client: configurable setting overrides per target host

It is now possible to set overrides for client settings per target host @ref[via configuration](../client-side/configuration.md#per-host-overrides). For example, if you use Akka HTTP client
to access different services, it is now possible to tweak pool and connection parameters like the maximum number of concurrent connections (`max-connections`) on a per-target-host-basis.
Thanks to [David Knapp / @Falmarri](https://github.com/Falmarri) for providing an initial implementation of that feature a long time ago.

### Client: custom client DNS resolution transport

By default, host name resolution is done in the IO layer when a connection attempt is made. In some cases, it can make sense to be able to customize the resolution, for example if
there are multiple ip addresses returned for a DNS query, this could be used to implement custom DNS load balancing schemes. For that purpose, a new `ClientTransport.withCustomResolver` was
introduced that allows providing custom resolution for each connection attempt.

See the section about @ref[custom client DNS resolution schemes](../client-side/client-transport.md#custom-host-name-resolution-transport) for more information.

### Performance improvements

 * Better performance for big client pools: Big client pools with more than 500 connections (`max-connections = 500` or more) suffered from a bad choice of datastructure with O(n²) access
   times, so bigger pools spent too much time just sifting through the internal data structures instead of doing useful work. This has been fixed and a nightly benchmark has been set
   up to track performance going forward.
 * Cheaper logging in client pools helps pools of all sizes by avoiding logging when DEBUG logging is disabled.
 * discardEntityBytes for strict entities is now a no-op while before streams were materialized.

### Streamlined HTTPS configuration

Akka HTTP no longer uses the HTTPS configuration configured with `ssl-config`
by default. Instead, it will use the JRE defaults for client connections. For
server connections you should create a @apidoc[HttpsConnectionContext] with
the relevant configuration.

See @ref[Configuring HTTPS connections](../migration-guide/migration-guide-10.2.x.md#configuring-https-connections) for more information.

### Other changes

* Various bug fixes, such as around [percent-encoding URI queries](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3003) and [parsing headers with unicode characters](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1484).
* RouteTest can now run integration tests with `~!>` through full client/server infrastructure [#3014](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3014)
* Various improvements to HTTP/2 support, driven by [Akka gRPC](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc).
* Remove legacy host connection pool including settings and tests [#3188](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3188)

### Migration notes

Support for Scala 2.11 has been dropped in this release. See the @ref[Migration guide](../migration-guide/migration-guide-10.2.x.md) for
more information about other changes which might need migration.
