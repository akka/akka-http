# 10.2.x Release Notes

## 10.2.0

### Migration notes

#### Scalatest dependency upgraded to 3.1.0

The Scalatest dependency for akka-http-testkit was upgraded to version 3.1.0. This version is incompatible with previous
versions. This is relevant for user code if it uses methods from @scaladoc[ScalatestUtils](akka.http.scaladsl.testkit.ScalatestUtils)
(which are in scope if your test extends from @scaladoc[ScalaTestRouteTest](akka.http.scaladsl.testkit.ScalaTestRouteTest)).
In this case, the project itself needs to update to use Scalatest >= 3.1.0.
