## 10.4.0

This release is the first under the new BSL license. For details about why the license is changing see [Why We Are Changing the License for Akka](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/why-we-are-changing-the-license-for-akka). Additionally the [detailed FAQ](https://www.lightbend.com/akka/license-faq) is available to answer many of
the questions that you may have about the license change.
