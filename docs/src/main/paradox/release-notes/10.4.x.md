# 10.4.x release notes

## 10.4.0

This release is the first under the new BSL license. For details about why the license is changing see [Why We Are Changing the License for Akka](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/why-we-are-changing-the-license-for-akka). Additionally the [detailed FAQ](https://www.lightbend.com/akka/license-faq) is available to answer many of
the questions that you may have about the license change. 

Akka 10.4.0 requires Akka 2.7.0 and will not work with earlier versions of Akka. Except for that it should be a drop in 
replacement for Akka HTTP 10.2.x.
