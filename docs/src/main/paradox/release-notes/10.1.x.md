# 10.1.x Release Notes

## 10.1.14

This release fixes [CVE-2021-23339](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23339), a vulnerability regarding interpretation of `Transfer-Encoding` headers. See
@ref:[Incorrect Handling Of Transfer-Encoding Header](../security/2021-02-24-incorrect-handling-of-Transfer-Encoding-header.md).

The vulnerability cannot be exploited using just Akka HTTP itself. Instead, Akka HTTP must be use as a proxy and the downstream server must be vulnerable itself, so
that the proxy and the downstream server disagree on how to interpret a malformed request containing both `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers potentially
leading to a "Request Smuggling" vulnerability. If you are using Akka HTTP as a reverse proxy, make sure to upgrade to the latest version.

Starting from this version, only a single `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header is allowed. HTTP/1.1 specifies other encodings, however, those are not supported or
implemented in Akka HTTP. Formerly, Akka HTTP would just pass on unsupported `Transfer-Encoding` headers to the user which lead to the above security issue. Since
Akka HTTP implements the "Transfer" part of the protocol, it seems reasonable to lock down allowed values for `Transfer-Encoding` to prevent security issues like this.
Please let us know if this leads to compatibility problems with your software.

## 10.1.13

### Changes since 10.1.12

#### akka-http-core

* Don't fail pool slot after previous connection failed in special condition [#3021](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3021)
* Make HttpEntity.Strict.discardBytes a no-op [#3329](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/3329)

## 10.1.12

### ALPN support in JDK >= 8u252

ALPN support was backported to recent JDK 8 updates. When using HTTP2 support with these JDKs, the `jetty-alpn-agent`
is not needed anymore. If you want to run on older and newer JDKs with the same command line, make sure to use the
most recent version of `jetty-alpn-agent` which will automatically disable itself for newer JDKs.

## 10.1.10

### Migration notes

[RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.6) dictates an HTTP response with status code 205 ('Reset Content') is not allowed to have an entity body. Since [#2686](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/2686) we enforce this restriction, so if you (incorrectly) produced such responses you will have to either remove the entity body or select a different status code.

## 10.1.5

10.1.5 is the sixth release in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.

It is mainly a mitigation for the [DoS vulnerability when using `decodeRequest`](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/08/30/akka-http-dos-vulnerability-found)

### Migration Notes

To avoid excessive memory usage we introduced two new limits that apply per default:

 * `akka.http.routing.decode-max-size`: This limit applies when you use `decodeRequest` to limit the amount of decompressed data. The default limit is 8 megabytes.
 * `akka.http.parsing.max-to-strict-bytes`: This limit applies when you use `HttpEntity.toStrict` or the `toStrictEntity` directive (and related directives). It will only collect up to the given amount data and fail otherwise. The default limit is 8 megabytes.

Depending on your application requirements, you may want to change these settings.

### **Changes since 10.1.4**

## 10.1.3

10.1.3 is the fourth release in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.

This release addresses a critical memory leak issue introduced by the graceful termination infrastructure added in 10.1.2.
No other risky changes are made in this release, in order to make it a trustworthy fix drop-in replacement of 10.1.2.

### **Changes since 10.1.2**

For a full overview you can also see the [10.1.3 milestone]( https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/41?closed=1):

#### Fixes in akka-http-core

 * ServerTerminator memory leak in 10.1.2 ([#2067](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2067))
 * Avoid eagerly failing connections when request closes ([#2066](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2066))

#### Fixes in docs

 * Correct pipelining-limit flag name ([#2059](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2059))
 * Fix link to compatibility rules section ([#2062](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2062))

#### Improvements in docs

 * Reference documentation for Graceful Termination ([#2072](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2072))
 * Enhance Caching Documentation ([#2060](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/2060))

## 10.1.2

10.1.2 is the third release in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.

Notably, this release:

 * Introduces "Graceful" Server Termination ([#118](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/118)): calling the newly introduced `terminate` on the `ServerBinding` will cause the binding to start gracefully rejecting new requests, while giving existing requests a deadline to complete normally.
 * Discards Entities in Default RejectionHandler ([#38](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/38)). Previously, when rejecting a request, the default rejection handler would not consume the request entity. The default rejection handlers have been updated to consume the request in this case.
 * Appends a newline to every element when streaming CSV (and NDJSON, [#1931](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1931)): Previously, CSV lines would only be interspersed with newlines, but no final newline would be sent. While arguably this was a bug in itself, it also had the unfortunate effect that a newline would only be emitted when the next CSV line became available, which is especially surprising in situations where CSV data is produced relatively slowly.

### **Changes since 10.1.1**

## 10.1.1

See the [announcement](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/03/27/akka-http-10.1.1-released.html) and
closed tickets on the [10.1.1 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/36?closed=1).

10.1.1 is the second release in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.


This release brings a number of small, yet long requested features, including:

 * automatic WebSocket keep-alive using `Ping` frames,
 * removing the need for implicit parameters in order to call `Route.seal` (in Scala DSL)

## 10.1.0

See the [announcement](https://akka.io/blog/news/2018/03/08/akka-http-10.1.0-released.html) and
closed tickets on the [10.1.0 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/35?closed=1).

10.1.0 is the first release in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.

The most important changes are:

 * Removing support for Akka 2.4.x which is at its end-of-life with the end of 2017. In the future, this will allow us
   to make use of features that only Akka 2.5 supports.
 * Removing methods that have been deprecated during the life-time of Akka HTTP 10.0.x. For now, methods only deprecated
   in the last release of Akka HTTP, 10.0.11, are not yet removed to allow for a smooth transition.
 * The new client pool implementation introduced in 10.0.11 is now the default. We have identified and fixed several
   bugs in the RC period so by now we are quite confident that the new client pool will be a solid replacement for the
   legacy one.
 * Documentation has been completely consolidated between Scala and Java pages. Hundreds of directive
   documentation pages have been merged  in a tireless effort by [@jonas](https://github.com/jonas),
   [@jlprat](https://github.com/jlprat), and Akka team's [@raboof](https://github.com/raboof).

### Akka is not an explicit dependency anymore / Removal of Akka 2.4 support

Akka HTTP 10.0.x has always supported Akka 2.5, while allowing users to still remain on Akka 2.4.x if they choose to do so.
By now Akka 2.4 has reached its end of life. Therefore, Akka HTTP 10.1.x only supports Akka >= 2.5.11
(and future versions during the life of Akka HTTP 10.1.x) so we will be able to make of features only provided by Akka 2.5.
In some cases we bump the minimum supported patch version of Akka to be able to use new features quickly.

Using Akka HTTP with Akka 2.5 used to be
a bit confusing, because Akka HTTP explicitly depended on Akka 2.4. Trying to use it together with Akka 2.5,
running an Akka HTTP application could fail with class loading issues if you forgot to add a dependency to
both `akka-actor` *and* `akka-stream` of the same version. For that reason, we changed the policy not to depend on `akka-stream`
explicitly anymore but mark it as a `provided` dependency in our build. That means that you will *always* have to add
a manual dependency to `akka-stream`. Please make sure you have chosen and added a dependency to `akka-stream` when
updating to the new version (veterans may remember this policy from Spray).

### Deprecation Removals

Methods were removed that have been deprecated during the life-time of Akka HTTP 10.0.x. Methods that were only deprecated
in the last release of Akka HTTP, 10.0.11, are not yet removed to allow for a smooth transition. In general, our guarantee
for minor release updates is that code that compiled on the latest version of the previous minor release (10.0.11 in this case)
should be both source and binary compatible with the latest version of the current minor release. We might make
exceptions to the rule for cases where the maintenance burden seems greater than the risk of breaking major users / third-party
libraries. We'll treat any other binary incompatibilities as regressions.

### New client pool implementation is now the default

The new client pool implementation introduced in 10.0.11 is now the default. Since 10.0.11, we fixed several bugs in the
new client pool implementation.
You can still fall back to the old implementation by setting `akka.http.host-connection-pool.pool-implementation = legacy`.

### Compatibility Notes

As the @ref[compatibility notes](../compatibility-guidelines.md) explain in detail, we guarantee binary compatibility. In
some cases, however, a new version is not strictly source compatible. We try to limit the impact of these kinds
of changes but sometimes, they are inevitable to improve the API.

Source incompatible changes are:

 * Removed deprecated methods from 10.0.x
 * `ServerBinding.unbind` return type has been changed to @scala[`Future[Done]`]@java[`CompletionStage[Done]`] for
   consistency.

### Support for Scala 2.13.0-M3

Akka HTTP 10.1.0 is released for Scala 2.11, 2.12, and 2.13.0-M3. Due to a [regression in Scala 2.13.0-M3](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/467)
tail call optimization does not apply anymore in some cases where it did before which might lead to stack overflow when
running with Scala 2.13.0-M3.


### Removal of OSGi support

Supporting OSGi is error prone and high maintenance and it repeatably broke, blocked releases, or metadata turned out to
be wrong. As we are no experts in OSGi, and are nowadays focusing our efforts on JDK9+ jigsaw compatibility
we had to remove OSGi support for now. If you care about OSGi support please step up and help out. Most important
would be adding tests that verify that the OSGi infrastructure does not break the build and the metadata actually works
at runtime. See [#1852](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1852) for more information.
