# Pluggable Client Transports / HTTPS Proxy Support

The client side infrastructure has (unstable) support to plug different transport mechanisms underneath. A client side
transport is represented by an instance of @javadoc[akka.http.javadsl.ClientTransport](akka.http.javadsl.ClientTransport):

@@snip [ClientTransport.scala](../../../../../../../akka-http-core/src/main/scala/akka/http/javadsl/ClientTransport.scala) { #client-transport-definition }

A transport implementation defines how the client infrastructure should communicate with a given host.

In our model, SSL/TLS runs on top of the client transport, even if you could theoretically see it as part of the
transport layer itself.

## Configuring Client Transports

A `ClientTransport` is configured slightly differently for the various layers of the HTTP client.
Right now, configuration is only possible with code (and not through config files). There's currently no 
predefined way that would allow you to select different transports per target host (but you can easily define any kind
of strategy by implementing `ClientTransport` yourself). 

### Connection Pool Usage

The `ConnectionPoolSettings` class allows setting a custom transport for any of the pool methods. Use 
`ConnectionPoolSettings.withTransport` to configure a transport and pass those settings to one of the
pool methods like `Http.get(...).singleRequest`, `Http.get(...).superPool`, or `Http.get(...).cachedHostConnectionPool`.

### Single Connection Usage

You can configure a custom transport for a single HTTP connection by passing it to the `Http().outgoingConnectionUsingTransport`
method.

## Predefined Transports

### TCP

The default transport is `ClientTransport.TCP` which simply opens a TCP connection to the target host.
 
### HTTPS Proxy

A transport that connects to target servers via an HTTPS proxy. An HTTPS proxy uses the HTTP `CONNECT` method (as 
specified in [RFC 7231 Section 4.3.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.6)) to create tunnels to target 
servers. The proxy itself should transparently forward data to the target servers so that end-to-end encryption should
still work (if TLS breaks, then the proxy might be fussing with your data).

Instantiate the HTTPS proxy transport using `ClientTransport.httpsProxy(proxyAddress)`.

In order to use the HTTPS proxy with proxy credentials, use  `ClientTransport.httpsProxy(proxyAddress, proxyAuth)`

## Implementing Custom Transports

Implement `ClientTransport.connectTo` to implement a custom client transport.

Here are some ideas for custom (or future predefined) transports:

 * SSH tunnel transport: connects to the target host through an SSH tunnel
 * Per-host configurable transport: allows choosing transports per target host

## Usage Examples

### Use HTTPS Proxy with `Http.get(...).singleRequest`
