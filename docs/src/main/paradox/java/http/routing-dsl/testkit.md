# Route Testkit

akka-http has a testkit that provides a convenient way of testing your routes with JUnit. It allows
running requests against a route (without hitting the network) and provides means to assert against
response properties in a compact way.

To use the testkit you need to take these steps:

 * add a dependency to the `akka-http-testkit` module
 * derive the test class from `JUnitRouteTest`
 * wrap the route under test with `RouteTest.testRoute` to create a `TestRoute`
 * run requests against the route using `TestRoute.run(request)` which will return
a `TestResponse`
 * use the methods of `TestResponse` to assert on properties of the response

## Example

To see the testkit in action consider the following simple calculator app service:

@@snip [MyAppService.java]($test$/java/docs/http/javadsl/server/testkit/MyAppService.java) { #simple-app }

`MyAppService` extends from `AllDirectives` which brings all of the directives into scope. We define a method called `createRoute`
that provides the routes to serve to `bindAndHandle`.

Here's how you would test that service:

@@snip [TestkitExampleTest.java]($test$/java/docs/http/javadsl/server/testkit/TestkitExampleTest.java) { #simple-app-testing }

## Writing Asserting against the HttpResponse

The testkit supports a fluent DSL to write compact assertions on the response by chaining assertions
using "dot-syntax". To simplify working with streamed responses the entity of the response is first "strictified", i.e.
entity data is collected into a single `ByteString` and provided the entity is supplied as an `HttpEntityStrict`. This
allows to write several assertions against the same entity data which wouldn't (necessarily) be possible for the
streamed version.

All of the defined assertions provide HTTP specific error messages aiding in diagnosing problems.

Currently, these methods are defined on `TestResponse` to assert on the response:

|Inspector                                                           | Description                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`assertStatusCode(int expectedCode)`                                | Asserts that the numeric response status code equals the expected one                                                               |
|`assertStatusCode(StatusCode expectedCode)`                         | Asserts that the response `StatusCode` equals the expected one                                                                      |
|`assertMediaType(String expectedType)`                              | Asserts that the media type part of the response's content type matches the given String                                            |
|`assertMediaType(MediaType expectedType)`                           | Asserts that the media type part of the response's content type matches the given `MediaType`                                       |
|`assertEntity(String expectedStringContent)`                        | Asserts that the entity data interpreted as UTF8 equals the expected String                                                         |
|`assertEntityBytes(ByteString expectedBytes)`                       | Asserts that the entity data bytes equal the expected ones                                                                          |
|`assertEntityAs(Unmarshaller<T> unmarshaller, expectedValue: T)`    | Asserts that the entity data if unmarshalled with the given marshaller equals the given value                                       |
|`assertHeaderExists(HttpHeader expectedHeader)`                     | Asserts that the response contains an HttpHeader instance equal to the expected one                                                 |
|`assertHeaderKindExists(String expectedHeaderName)`                 | Asserts that the response contains a header with the expected name                                                                  |
|`assertHeader(String name, String expectedValue)`                   | Asserts that the response contains a header with the given name and value.                                                          |

It's, of course, possible to use any other means of writing assertions by inspecting the properties the response
manually. As written above, `TestResponse.entity` and `TestResponse.response` return strict versions of the
entity data.

## Supporting Custom Test Frameworks

Adding support for a custom test framework is achieved by creating new superclass analogous to
`JUnitRouteTest` for writing tests with the custom test framework deriving from `akka.http.javadsl.testkit.RouteTest`
and implementing its abstract methods. This will allow users of the test framework to use `testRoute` and
to write assertions using the assertion methods defined on `TestResponse`.

## Testing sealed Routes

The section above describes how to test a "regular" branch of your route structure, which reacts to incoming requests
with HTTP response parts or rejections. Sometimes, however, you will want to verify that your service also translates
@ref[Rejections](rejections.md) to HTTP responses in the way you expect.

You do this by calling the `seal()` method of the `Route` class. The `seal()` method applies the logic of @ref[ExceptionHandler](exception-handling.md) and
@ref[RejectionHandler](rejections.md#the-rejectionhandler) passed as method arguments to all exceptions and rejections coming back from the route,
and translates them to the respective `HttpResponse`.

## Testing Route fragments

Since the testkit is request-based, you cannot test requests that are illegal or impossible in HTTP. One
such instance is testing a route that begins with the `pathEnd` directive, such as this:

@@snip [MyAppFragment.java]($test$/java/docs/http/javadsl/server/testkit/MyAppFragment.java) { #source-quote }

However, it is impossible to unit test this Route directly using testkit, since it is impossible to create an
empty HTTP request. To test this type of route, embed it in a synthetic route in your test, for example:

@@snip [TestKitFragmentTest.java]($test$/java/docs/http/javadsl/server/testkit/TestKitFragmentTest.java) { #source-quote }


## Accounting for Slow Test Systems

The timeouts you consciously defined on your lightning fast development environment might be too tight for your, most
probably, high-loaded Continuous Integration server, invariably causing spurious failures. To account for such
situations, timeout durations can be scaled by a given factor on such environments. Check the
@extref[Akka Docs](akka-docs:java/testing.html#accounting-for-slow-test-systems) for further information.


## Increase Timeout

The default timeout when testing your routes using the testkit is 3 seconds. Sometimes, though, this might not be enough.
In order to extend this default timeout, to say 5 seconds, just override the following method:

@@snip [WithTimeoutTest.java]($test$/java/docs/http/javadsl/server/testkit/WithTimeoutTest.java) { #timeout-setting }
