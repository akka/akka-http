# recoverRejections

## Description

**Low level directive** â€“ unless you're sure you need to be working on this low-level you might instead
want to try the @ref[handleRejections-java](../execution-directives/handleRejections.md#handlerejections-java) directive which provides a nicer DSL for building rejection handlers.

Transforms rejections from the inner route with a `Function<Iterable<Rejection>, RouteResult>`.
A `RouteResult` is either a `Complete` containing the `HttpResponse` or a `Rejected` containing the
rejections.

> **Note:**
To learn more about how and why rejections work read the @ref[Rejections](../../rejections.md#rejections-java) section of the documentation.
