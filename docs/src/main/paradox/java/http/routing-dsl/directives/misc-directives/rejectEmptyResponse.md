# rejectEmptyResponse

## Description

Replaces a response with no content with an empty rejection.

The `rejectEmptyResponse` directive is mostly used with marshalling `Optional<T>` instances. The value `None` is
usually marshalled to an empty but successful result. In many cases `None` should instead be handled as
`404 Not Found` which is the effect of using `rejectEmptyResponse`.
