# mapRouteResultFuture

## Description

Asynchronous version of @ref[mapRouteResult](mapRouteResult.md).

It's similar to @ref[mapRouteResultWith](mapRouteResultWith.md), however it's
`Function<CompletionStage<RouteResult>, CompletionStage<RouteResult>>`
instead of `Function<RouteResult, CompletionStage<RouteResult>>` which may be useful when
combining multiple transformations and / or wanting to `recover` from a failed route result.

See @ref[Result Transformation Directives](index.md#result-transformation-directives-java) for similar directives.

## Example
