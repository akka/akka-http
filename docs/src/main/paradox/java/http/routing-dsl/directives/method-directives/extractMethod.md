# extractMethod

## Description

Extracts the `HttpMethod` from the request context and provides it for use for other directives explicitly.

## Example

In the below example our route first matches all `GET` requests, and if an incoming request wasn't a `GET`,
the matching continues and the extractMethod route will be applied which we can use to programatically
print what type of request it was - independent of what actual HttpMethod it was:

## Custom Http Method

When you define a custom HttpMethod, you can define a route using extractMethod.
