# pathEnd

## Description

Only passes the request to its inner route if the unmatched path of the `RequestContext` is empty, i.e. the request
path has been fully matched by a higher-level @ref[path](path.md) or @ref[pathPrefix](pathPrefix.md) directive.

This directive is a simple alias for `rawPathPrefix(PathEnd)` and is mostly used on an
inner-level to discriminate "path already fully matched" from other alternatives (see the example below). For a comparison between path directives check @ref[Overview of path directives](index.md#overview-path-java).
