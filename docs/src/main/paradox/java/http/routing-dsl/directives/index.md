# Directives

A "Directive" is a small building block used for creating arbitrarily complex @ref[route structures](../routes.md#routes).
Akka HTTP already pre-defines a large number of directives and you can easily construct your own:

@@toc { depth=1 }

@@@ index

* [alphabetically](alphabetically.md)
* [by-trait](by-trait.md)
* [custom-directives](custom-directives.md)

@@@

## Basics

@ref[Routes](../routes.md#routes-java) effectively are simply highly specialised functions that take a `RequestContext` and eventually `complete` it, 
which could (and often should) happen asynchronously.

With the @ref[complete-java](route-directives/complete.md#complete-java) directive this becomes even shorter:

```java
Route route = complete("yeah");
```

Writing multiple routes that are tried as alternatives (in-order of definition), is as simple as using the `route(route1, route2)`,
method:

```java
Route routes = route(
  pathSingleSlash(() ->
    getFromResource("web/calculator.html")
  ),
  path("hello", () -> complete("World!))
);
```

You could also simply define a "catch all" completion by providing it as the last route to attempt to match.
In the example below we use the `get()` (one of the @ref[MethodDirectives](method-directives/index.md#methoddirectives-java)) to match all incoming `GET`
requests for that route, and all other requests will be routed towards the other "catch all" route, that completes the route:

```java
Route route =
  get(
    () -> complete("Received GET")
  ).orElse(
    () -> complete("Received something else")
  )
```

If no route matches a given request, a default `404 Not Found` response will be returned as response.

## Structure

The general anatomy of a directive is as follows:

```java
directiveName(arguments [, ...], (extractions [, ...]) -> {
  ... // inner route
})
```

It has a name, zero or more arguments and optionally an inner route (The @ref[RouteDirectives](route-directives/index.md#routedirectives-java) are special in that they
are always used at the leaf-level and as such cannot have inner routes).

Additionally directives can "extract" a number of values and make them available to their inner routes as function
arguments. When seen "from the outside" a directive with its inner route form an expression of type `Route`.

## What Directives do

A directive can do one or more of the following:

 * Transform the incoming `RequestContext` before passing it on to its inner route (i.e. modify the request)
 * Filter the `RequestContext` according to some logic, i.e. only pass on certain requests and reject others
 * Extract values from the `RequestContext` and make them available to its inner route as "extractions"
 * Chain some logic into the `RouteResult` future transformation chain (i.e. modify the response or rejection)
 * Complete the request

This means a `Directive` completely wraps the functionality of its inner route and can apply arbitrarily complex
transformations, both (or either) on the request and on the response side.
