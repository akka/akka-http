# extractCredentials

## Description

Extracts the potentially present `HttpCredentials` provided with the request's `Authorization` header,
which can be then used to implement some custom authentication or authorization logic.

See @ref[Credentials and password timing attacks](index.md#credentials-and-timing-attacks-java) for details about verifying the secret.
