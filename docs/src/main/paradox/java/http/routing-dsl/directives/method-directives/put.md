# put

Matches requests with HTTP method `PUT`.

## Description

This directive filters the incoming request by its HTTP method. Only requests with
method `PUT` are passed on to the inner route. All others are rejected with a
@unidoc[MethodRejection], which is translated into a `405 Method Not Allowed` response
by the default `RejectionHandler`.

## Example
