# withSettings

## Description

Allows running an inner route using an alternative `RoutingSettings` in place of the default one.

The execution context can be extracted in an inner route using @ref[extractSettings](extractSettings.md) directly,
or used by directives which internally extract the materializer without surfacing this fact in the API.

## Example
