# Release Notes

## 10.0.10

### Support for HTTP(S) proxies with Authorization

It is now possible to connect to @scala[@ref[HTTP(S) Proxies](client-side/client-transport.md)]@java[@ref[HTTP(S) Proxies](client-side/client-transport.md)]
that require an authorization via an `Proxy-Authorization` header. This can be set up directly on the `ClientTransport` object when configuring the proxy.

## 10.0.9

This release fixes a regression in 10.0.8 that occurred when using media ranges and connecting to a HTTP server that fails to specify the charset in the `ContentType` [#1222](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1222).

Additionally, support for HTTP status code 418 has been introduced [#1206](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1206)

## 10.0.8

### HTTP(S) Proxy Support

Long awaited support for configuring an @scala[@ref[HTTP(S) CONNECT Proxy](client-side/client-transport.md#use-https-proxy-with-http-singlerequest)]@java[@ref[HTTP(S) CONNECT Proxy](client-side/client-transport.md#use-https-proxy-with-http-get-singlerequest)]
for the client has arrived. Thanks a lot, [Michal Sitko (@note)](https://github.com/note), who implemented the feature.

Support for proxies that require authentication is yet to be implemented and is tracked by the ticket [#1213](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1213)

### Ability to express textual content types with missing character set

Akka-http has a strongly typed media type / content type system, and knows at compile time about which media types
are supposed to express a character set attribute, e.g. `text/plain; charset=UTF-8`. Before this release, akka would
silently assume UTF-8 for `ContentType` instances of media types with a missing `charset` attribute.

From now on, content types missing a charset can be both parsed and expressed directly, using the new
`ContentType.WithMissingCharset` trait/class.

- For incoming Content-Type headers with values missing a charset, such as `text/plain`, the header
  `ContentType` will be represented as `WithMissingCharset`, rather than assuming an UTF-8 charset
  (which could have been a wrong guess).
- If you need to create such a content type programmatically, use e.g. ```MediaTypes.`text/plain`.withMissingCharset```
  (scala) or `MediaTypes.TEXT_PLAIN.toContentTypeWithMissingCharset()` (java).

*Note to scala users*: If you have `match` statements across `ContentType`, keep an eye out for new compiler hints. You need
to decide what what to do in case you get a content type with a missing character set, by adding a
`ContentType.WithMissingCharset` case.

### Server-Sent Events Support

Support for Server-Sent events was added by merging akka-sse project by [@hseeberger](https://github.com/hseeberger). Thank you very much, Heiko!

## 10.0.7

### New Seed Templates for Akka HTTP Apps

We prepared new seed templates for starting out with Akka HTTP using the [Java DSL](https://github.com/akka/akka-http-java-seed.g8)
as well as [Scala DSL](https://github.com/akka/akka-http-scala-seed.g8). By using the `sbt new` command one can now easily get a
small sample project to easily get started with your first Akka HTTP app. More instructions on the seed template pages.

### New Path Directive `ignoreTrailingSlash`

Akka HTTP treats differently by default a route that ends with slash (`/`) than one that doesn't. From this version on,
users who don't want to have this distinction, can use a new Path Directive called `ignoreTrailingSlash`.
This route, will retry its inner route with and without a trailing slash. If you want to know more about this feature,
please check the @ref[documentation page](routing-dsl/directives/path-directives/ignoreTrailingSlash.md).

### List of Changes

#### Improvements

##### akka-http
 * Added new Path Directive `ignoreTrailingSlash` ([#880](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/880))

 * Migrated to the new docs theme (same as Akka) ([#1129](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1129))
 * (ApiMayChange) `HttpApp#route` method was renamed to `routes` to highlight it is "all the routes" ([#953](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/953))

#### akka-http2-support
 * Synthetic Remote-Address header setting is now honored in HTTP2 server blueprint ([#1088](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/1088))

@@@ warning

This release contains a fix for a serious security vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to shut down any Akka
HTTP application using the routing DSL. See the

closed tickets on the [10.0.5 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/22?closed=1).

This is the fifth maintenance release of the Akka HTTP 10.0 series. It is primarily aimed at stability aligning the internals with the upcoming Akka 2.5 release.

### Compatibility notes

This version of Akka HTTP must be used with Akka in version at-least 2.4.17, however it is also compatible with Akka 2.5, which has just released its Release Candidate 1.


## 10.0.4

See the [announcement](http://akka.io/news/2017/02/23/akka-http-10.0.4-released.html) and
closed tickets on the [10.0.4 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/21?closed=1).

This release contains mostly bug fixes and smaller improvements. We strongly recommend updating from 10.0.3 which
introduced a regression that an Akka HTTP server can leak memory over time which will lead to OOM eventually.
See [#851](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/851) for more information.

### List of Changes

#### Improvements

##### akka-http
 * `HttpApp` now directly extends from Directives ([#875](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/875))
 * Added `HttpApp.startServer(host, port)` for even simpler startup. ([#873](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/873))

##### akka-http2-support

 * Lots of small cleanups and improvements

#### Bug Fixes

##### akka-http-core
 * Fix a regression introduced in 10.0.3 that might lead to memory leaking after a server connection has been closed. ([#851](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/851))
 * Fix the infamous "Cannot push/pull twice" bug which occurred in relation with 100-Continue requests (like any kind
   of uploads of POST requests done with `curl`) ([#516](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/516))

##### Build + Testing Infrastructure
 * Updated Akka dependency to Akka 2.4.17. ([#858](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/858))

   to give hints about the stability of interfaces. ([#727](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/727))

## 10.0.3

See the [announcement](http://akka.io/news/2017/01/26/akka-http-10.0.3-released.html) and
closed tickets on the [10.0.3 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/19?closed=1).

This release contains mostly bug fixes, a huge number of contributed documentation fixes and
small improvements.

### HttpApp

A notable new feature is the experimental `HttpApp` feature (long time users may know it from spray). It allows
to create an Akka HTTP server with very little boilerplate. See its @ref[documentation](routing-dsl/HttpApp.md). Thanks a lot, [@jlprat](https://github.com/jlprat) for
contributing this feature and carrying through the PR with the most comments so far.

### Changed semantics

In some cases, we need to change semantics slightly to fix bugs. Some user code may still rely on the
previous behavior so we are listing them here to bring attention to potential issues.

 * `Uri.Authority.toString` now doesn't render leading double slashes any more ([#784](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/784))
 * request URIs for requests coming in for a server set up to use TLS now carry the `https` scheme ([#658](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues/658))
