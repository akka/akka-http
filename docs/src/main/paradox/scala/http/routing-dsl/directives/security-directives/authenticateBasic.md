## Description

Wraps the inner route with Http Basic authentication support using a given `Authenticator[T]`.

Provides support for handling [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_auth).

Given a function returning `Some[T]` upon successful authentication and `None` otherwise,
respectively applies the inner route or rejects the request with a `AuthenticationFailedRejection` rejection,
which by default is mapped to an `401 Unauthorized` response.

Longer-running authentication tasks (like looking up credentials in a database) should use the @ref[authenticateBasicAsync](authenticateBasicAsync.md#authenticatebasicasync)
variant of this directive which allows it to run without blocking routing layer of Akka HTTP, freeing it for other requests.

Standard HTTP-based authentication which uses the `WWW-Authenticate` header containing challenge data and
`Authorization` header for receiving credentials is implemented in subclasses of `HttpAuthenticator`.

See @ref[Credentials and password timing attacks](index.md#credentials-and-timing-attacks-scala) for details about verifying the secret.

> **Warning:**
Make sure to use basic authentication only over SSL/TLS because credentials are transferred in plaintext.
