# mapRequest

## Signature

@@signature [BasicDirectives.scala](../../../../../../../../../akka-http/src/main/scala/akka/http/scaladsl/server/directives/BasicDirectives.scala) { #mapRequest }

## Description

Transforms the request before it is handled by the inner route.

The `mapRequest` directive is used as a building block for @ref[Custom Directives](../custom-directives.md#custom-directives) to transform a request before it
is handled by the inner route. Changing the `request.uri` parameter has no effect on path matching in the inner route
because the unmatched path is a separate field of the `RequestContext` value which is passed into routes. To change
the unmatched path or other fields of the `RequestContext` use the @ref[mapRequestContext](mapRequestContext.md#maprequestcontext) directive.

See @ref[Request Transforming Directives](index.md#request-transforming-directives) for an overview of similar directives.
