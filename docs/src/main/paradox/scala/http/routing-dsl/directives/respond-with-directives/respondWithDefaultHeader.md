# respondWithDefaultHeader

## Signature

@@signature [RespondWithDirectives.scala]($akka-http$/akka-http/src/main/scala/akka/http/scaladsl/server/directives/RespondWithDirectives.scala) { #respondWithDefaultHeader }

## Description

Adds a given HTTP header to all responses coming back from its inner route only if a header with the same name doesn't
exist yet in the response.

This directive transforms `HttpResponse` and `ChunkedResponseStart` messages coming back from its inner route by
potentially adding the given `HttpHeader` instance to the headers list.
The header is only added if there is no header instance with the same name (case insensitively) already present in the
response.

See also @ref[respondWithDefaultHeaders](respondWithDefaultHeaders.md)  if you'd like to add more than one header.
