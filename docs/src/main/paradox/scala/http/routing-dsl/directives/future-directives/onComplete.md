# onComplete

## Signature

@@signature [FutureDirectives.scala]($akka-http$/akka-http/src/main/scala/akka/http/scaladsl/server/directives/FutureDirectives.scala) { #onComplete }

## Description

Evaluates its parameter of type `Future[T]`, and once the `Future` has been completed, extracts its
result as a value of type `Try[T]` and passes it to the inner route.

To handle the `Failure` case automatically and only work with the result value, use @ref[onSuccess](onSuccess.md).

To complete with a successful result automatically and just handle the failure result, use @ref[completeOrRecoverWith](completeOrRecoverWith.md), instead.

## Example

@@snip [FutureDirectivesExamplesSpec.scala]($test$/scala/docs/http/scaladsl/server/directives/FutureDirectivesExamplesSpec.scala) { #onComplete }

@@@ note
Using the `onComplete` directive means that you'll have to explicitly and manually handle failure cases. Doing this for every route in your app will result in a lot of boilerplate code. Most of the time you want to use the @ref[Exception Handling](../../exception-handling.md) mechanism instead.

@@@ note
The identically named `onComplete` method of Scala's `Future` (from the standard library) does not work at all in this context since it's just a method that returns `Unit` - whereas Akka HTTP's `onComplete` is a `Directive` that creates a @unidoc[Route].
