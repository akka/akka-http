# authorize

## Signature

FIXME@@snip [SecurityDirectives.scala](../../../../../../../../../akka-http/src/main/scala/akka/http/scaladsl/server/directives/SecurityDirectives.scala) { #authorize }

## Description

Applies the given authorization check to the request.

The user-defined authorization check can either be supplied as a `=> Boolean` value which is calculated
just from information out of the lexical scope, or as a function `RequestContext => Boolean` which can also
take information from the request itself into account.

If the check returns `true` the request is passed on to the inner route unchanged, otherwise an
`AuthorizationFailedRejection` is created, triggering a `403 Forbidden` response by default
(the same as in the case of an `AuthenticationFailedRejection`).

In a common use-case you would check if a user (e.g. supplied by any of the `authenticate*` family of directives,
e.g. @ref[authenticateBasic](authenticateBasic.md#authenticatebasic)) is allowed to access the inner routes, e.g. by checking if the user has the needed permissions.

See also @ref[authorizeAsync](authorizeAsync.md#authorizeasync) for the asynchronous version of this directive.

> **Note:**
See also @ref[Authentication vs. Authorization](index.md#authentication-vs-authorization-scala) to understand the differences between those.
