IntelliJ IDEA
-------------

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) from JetBrains is one of the leading IDEs in the Java/Scala community,
and it has excellent support for Akka HTTP. This section of the tutorial describes how to set up, test and run the
sample project in IntelliJ.

## Setting up the project

To add the Akka HTTP example project to IntelliJ, follow these steps:

1. Open IntelliJ.
1. Select **Open** from the Welcome dialog or **File &gt; Open** from the Editor.
1. Browse to select the top-level directory of the sample project and click **OK**.

IntelliJ opens the project.

## Running the application

In the **Project** pane, right-click the `QuickstartServer` source file. Select **Run 'QuickstartServer'**. The
output should look like the output in the shell:

## Tutorial done!

Congratulations! You can start building real-world applications that use Akka HTTP. Of course, we didn't have time
to cover all Akka HTTP features in this short guide. See the
@ref[documentation](../index.md) to learn more.
