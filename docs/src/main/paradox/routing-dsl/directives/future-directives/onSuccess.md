## Signature

@@signature [FutureDirectives.scala]($akka-http$/akka-http/src/main/scala/akka/http/scaladsl/server/directives/FutureDirectives.scala) { #onSuccess }

@@@

## Description

Evaluates its parameter of type @scala[`Future[T]`]@java[`CompletionStage<T>`], and once it has been completed successfully,
extracts its result as a value of type `T` and passes it to the inner route.

If the future fails its failure throwable is bubbled up to the nearest @unidoc[ExceptionHandler].

To handle the `Failure` case manually as well, use @ref[onComplete](onComplete.md), instead.
