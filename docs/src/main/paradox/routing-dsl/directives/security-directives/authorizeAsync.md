## Description

The user-defined authorization check can either be supplied as a @scala[`=> Future[Boolean]`]@java[`Supplier<CompletionStage<Boolean>>`] value which is calculated
just from information out of the lexical scope, or as a function @scala[`RequestContext => Future[Boolean]`]@java[`Function<RequestContext,CompletionStage<Boolean>>`] which can also
take information from the request itself into account.

If the check returns `true` or the @scala[`Future`]@java[`CompletionStage`] is failed the request is passed on to the inner route unchanged,
otherwise an @unidoc[AuthorizationFailedRejection] is created, triggering a `403 Forbidden` response by default
(the same as in the case of an @unidoc[AuthenticationFailedRejection]).

In a common use-case you would check if a user (e.g. supplied by any of the `authenticate*` family of directives,
e.g. @ref[authenticateBasic](authenticateBasic.md)) is allowed to access the inner routes, e.g. by checking if the user has the needed permissions.

See also @ref[authorize](authorize.md) for the synchronous version of this directive.

See also @ref[Authentication vs. Authorization](index.md#authentication-vs-authorization) to understand the differences between those.
