## Description

Extracts the request's underlying @unidoc[RequestContext].

This directive is used as a building block for most of the other directives,
which extract the context and by inspecting some of it's values can decide
what to do with the request - for example provide a value, or reject the request.

See also @ref[extractRequest](extractRequest.md) if only interested in the @unidoc[HttpRequest] instance itself.
