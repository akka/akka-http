@@@

## Description

**Low level directive** â€“ unless you're sure you need to be working on this low-level you might instead
want to try the @ref[handleRejections](../execution-directives/handleRejections.md) directive which provides a nicer DSL for building rejection handlers.

The `mapRejections` directive is used as a building block for @ref[Custom Directives](../custom-directives.md) to transform a list
of rejections from the inner route to a new list of rejections.

See @ref[Response Transforming Directives](index.md#response-transforming-directives) for similar directives.
