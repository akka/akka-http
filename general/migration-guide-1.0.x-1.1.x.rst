Migration Guide 1.0.x to 1.1.x
===================================

**Akka has now moved to Scala 2.9.x**


Akka HTTP
---------

# akka.servlet.Initializer has been moved to ``akka-kernel`` to be able to have ``akka-http`` not depend on ``akka-remote``, if you don't want to use the class for kernel, just create your own version of ``akka.servlet.Initializer``, it's just a couple of lines of code and there is instructions here: `Akka Http Docs <http>`_
# akka.http.ListWriter has been removed in full, if you use it and want to keep using it, here's the code: `ListWriter <https://github.com/jboner/akka/blob/v1.0/akka-http/src/main/scala/akka/http/ListWriter.scala>`_
# Jersey-server is now a "provided" dependency for ``akka-http``, so you'll need to add the dependency to your project, it's built against Jersey 1.3

Akka Actor
----------

# is now dependency free, with the exception of the dependency on the ``scala-library.jar``
# does not bundle any logging anymore, but you can subscribe to events within Akka by registering an event handler on akka.aevent.EventHandler or by specifying the ``FQN`` of an Actor in the akka.conf under akka.event-handlers; there is an ``akka-slf4j`` module which still provides the Logging trait and a default ``SLF4J`` logger adapter.
Don't forget to add a SLF4J backend though, we recommend:

.. code-block:: scala
    lazy val logback = "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "0.9.28"

# If you used HawtDispatcher and want to continue using it, you need to include akka-dispatcher-extras.jar from Akka Modules, in your akka.conf you need to specify: ``akka.dispatch.HawtDispatcherConfigurator`` instead of ``HawtDispatcher``
# FSM: the onTransition method changed from Function1 to PartialFunction; there is an implicit conversion for the precise types in place, but it may be necessary to add an underscore if you are passing an eta-expansion (using a method as function value).

Akka Typed Actor
----------------

All methods starting with 'get*' are deprecated and will be removed in post 1.1 release.

Akka Remote
-----------

# ``UnparsebleException`` has been renamed to ``CannotInstantiateRemoteExceptionDueToRemoteProtocolParsingErrorException(exception, classname, message)``

Akka Testkit
------------

The TestKit moved into the akka-testkit subproject and correspondingly into the ``akka.testkit` package.
