# Mima filters needed to check newer versions against 10.0.1

# Method is currently only called from akka-http-spray-json-marshaller on a known marshaller under our control.
# It could be a problem if code compiled with 10.0.1 calls `andThen` on a general `Unmarshaller`. If someone
# passes in such an Unmarshaller that was compiled with 10.0.0 it would then fail. The likelihood is small
# so we are ignoring that for now.
