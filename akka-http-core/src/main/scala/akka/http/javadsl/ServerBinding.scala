  /**
   * Triggers "graceful" termination request being handled on this connection.
   *
   * Termination works as follows:
   *
   * 1) Unbind:
   * - the server port is unbound; no new connections will be accepted.
   *
   * 1.5) Immediately the ServerBinding `whenTerminationSignalIssued` future is completed.
   * This can be used to signal parts of the application that the http server is shutting down and they should clean up as well.
   * Note also that for more advanced shut down scenarios you may want to use the Coordinated Shutdown capabilities of Akka.
   *
   * 2) if a connection has no "in-flight" request, it is terminated immediately
   *
   * 3) Handle in-flight request:
   * - if a request is "in-flight" (being handled by user code), it is given `hardDeadline` time to complete,
   *   - if user code emits a response within the timeout, then this response is sent to the client with a `Connection: close` header and the connection is closed.
   *     - however if it is a streaming response, it is also mandated that it shall complete within the deadline, and if it does not
   *       the connection will be terminated regardless of status of the streaming response (this is because such response could be infinite,
   *       which could trap the server in a situation where it could not terminate if it were to wait for a response to "finish")
   *     - existing streaming responses must complete before the deadline as well.
   *       When the deadline is reached the connection will be terminated regardless of status of the streaming responses.
   *   - if user code does not reply with a response within the deadline we produce a special [[akka.http.javadsl.settings.ServerSettings.getTerminationDeadlineExceededResponse]]
   *     HTTP response (e.g. 503 Service Unavailable)
   *
   * 4) Keep draining incoming requests on existing connection:
   * - The existing connection will remain alive for until the `hardDeadline` is exceeded,
   *   yet no new requests will be delivered to the user handler. All such drained responses will be replied to with an
   *   termination response (as explained in phase 3).
   *
   * 5) Close still existing connections
   * - Connections are terminated forcefully once the `hardDeadline` is exceeded.
   *   The `whenTerminated` future is completed as well, so the graceful termination (of the `ActorSystem` or entire JVM
   *   itself can be safely performed, as by then it is known that no connections remain alive to this server).
   *
   * Note that the termination response is configurable in [[akka.http.javadsl.settings.ServerSettings]], and by default is an `503 Service Unavailable`,
   * with an empty response entity.
   *
   * @param hardDeadline timeout after which all requests and connections shall be forcefully terminated
   * @return completion stage which completes successfully with a marker object once all connections have been terminated
